    "\"Gematria\" is a system for assigning a number to a word by summing the numeric values of each of the letters as defined by the Mispar godol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria). For English characters, we can use the ASCII table (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). It is not necessary, however, to encode this table in our program as Python provides the `ord` function to convert a character to its \"ordinal\" (order in the ASCII table) value as well as the `chr` function to convert a number to its \"character.\""
